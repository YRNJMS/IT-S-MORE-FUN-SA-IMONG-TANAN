                <h3>UVED</h3>
                <p>Called ‘tabtab‘ in Sabtang (one of the 3 inhabited islands in Batanes).
                    It’s basically made of finely-grated corn (which is found at the base of a trunk of a banana plant) that’s mixed with ground meat (beef or pork), and minced fish. Afterward, it is seasoned with onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. This will be rolled into balls or served as-is and can either be with or without its broth.

                <h3>DIBANG</h3>
                <p>A common fish that you will find in the islands is dibang or flying fish — yes, it does ‘fly’ or leap out of the water, a defense mechanism to evade predators. To date, it has different variations.
